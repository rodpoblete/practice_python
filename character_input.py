"""Create a program that asks the user to enter their name and their age. Print out a message addressed to them that
tells them the year that they will turn 100 years old.

Extras:

    Add on to the previous program by asking the user for another number and printing out that many copies of the
    previous message. (Hint: order of operations exists in Python) Print out that many copies of the previous message
    on separate lines. (Hint: the string "\n is the same as pressing the ENTER button)
